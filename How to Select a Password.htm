<h1>How I’d Hack Your Weak Passwords</h1>

<p class=postinfo>Posted on <strong>Mar 26, 2007 - 2:17am </strong>by <a

<p><a href="http://onemansblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/UserLogin.jpg"></a>If
you invited me to try and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking">crack your password</a>,
you know the one that you use over and over for like every web page you visit,
how many guesses would it take before I got it? </p>

<p>Let’s see… here is my top 10 list. I can obtain most of this information
much <a href="http://onemansblog.com/2006/10/02/investigate-yourself-for-free/">easier
than you think</a>, then I might just be able to get into your e-mail,
computer, or online banking. After all, if I get into one I’ll probably get
into all of them.</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Your partner, child, or pet’s name, possibly followed by a
     0 or 1 (because they’re always making you use a number, aren’t they?)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The last 4 digits of your social security number.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>123 or 1234 or 123456.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“password”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Your city, or college, football team name.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Date of birth - yours, your partner’s or your child’s.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“god”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“letmein”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“money”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“love”</li>
</ol>

<p>Statistically speaking that should probably cover about 20% of you. But
don’t worry. If I didn’t get it yet it will probably only take a few more
minutes before I do…<br>
<br>
Hackers, and I’m not talking about the ethical kind, have developed a whole
range of tools to get at your personal data. And the main impediment standing
between your information remaining safe, or leaking out, <strong>is the
password you choose</strong>. (Ironically, the best protection people have is
usually the one they take least seriously.) </p>

<p>One of the simplest ways to gain access to your information is through the
use of a <a
href="http://onemansblog.com/2006/10/02/investigate-yourself-for-free/">Brute
Force Attack</a>. This is accomplished when a hacker uses a specially written
piece of software to attempt to log into a site using your credentials. <a
href="http://insecure.org/">Insecure.org</a> has a list of the Top 10 FREE
Password Crackers <a href="http://sectools.org/crackers.html">right here</a>.</p>

<p>So, how would one use this process to actually breach your personal
security? Simple. Follow my logic:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>You probably use the same password for lots of stuff
     right?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Some sites you access such as your Bank or work VPN
     probably have pretty decent security, so I’m not going to attack them.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>However, other sites like the Hallmark e-mail greeting
     cards site, an <a href="http://forums.htmlhelp.com/">online forum</a> you
     frequent, or an e-commerce site you’ve shopped at might not be as well
     prepared. So those are the ones I’d work on.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>So, all we have to do now is unleash <a
     href="http://www.hoobie.net/brutus/">Brutus</a>, <a
     href="http://www.darknet.org.uk/2006/12/wwwhack-19-download-wwwhack19zip-web-hacking-tool/">wwwhack</a>,
     or <a href="http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/">THC Hydra</a> on their server
     with instructions to try say 10,000 (or 100,000 - whatever makes you
     happy) different usernames and passwords as fast as possible.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Once we’ve got several login+password pairings we can then
     go back and test them on targeted sites.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>But wait… How do I know which bank you use and what your
     login ID is for the sites you frequent? All those cookies are simply
     stored, unencrypted and nicely named, in your Web browser’s cache. (Read <a
     href="http://onemansblog.com/2007/02/02/protect-your-privacy-delete-internet-usage-tracks/">this
     post</a> to remedy that problem.)</li>
</ul>

<p>And how fast <a
href="http://geodsoft.com/howto/password/cracking_passwords.htm">could this be
done</a>? Well, that depends on three main things, the length and complexity of
your password, the speed of the hacker’s computer, and the speed of the
hacker’s Internet connection. </p>

<p>Assuming the hacker has a reasonably fast connection and PC here is an
estimate of the amount of time it would take to generate every possible
combination of passwords for a given number of characters. After generating the
list it’s just a matter of time before the computer runs through all the
possibilities - or gets shut down trying.</p>

<p>Pay particular attention to the difference between using only lowercase
characters and using all possible characters (uppercase, lowercase, and special
characters - like @#$%^&amp;*). Adding just one capital letter and one asterisk
would change the processing time for an 8 character password from 2.4 days to
2.1 centuries.</p>

<p>Remember, these are just for an average computer, and these assume you
aren’t using <em>any word in the dictionary</em>. If Google put their computer
to work on it they’d finish about 1,000 times faster.</p>

<p>Now, I could go on for hours and hours more about all sorts of ways to
compromise your security and generally make your life miserable - but 95% of
those methods begin with <em>compromising your weak password</em>. So, why not
just protect yourself from the start and sleep better at night?</p>

<p>Believe me, I understand the need to choose passwords that are memorable.
But if you’re going to do that how about using something that no one is ever
going to guess AND doesn’t contain any common word or phrase in it. </p>

<p>Here are some password tips:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Randomly substitute numbers for letters that look similar.
     The letter ‘o’ becomes the number ‘0&#8242;, or even better an ‘@’ or ‘*’.
     (i.e. - m0d3ltf0rd… like modelTford)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Randomly throw in capital letters (i.e. - Mod3lTF0rd)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Think of something you were attached to when you were
     younger, but DON’T CHOOSE A PERSON’S NAME! Every name plus every word in
     the dictionary will fail under a simple brute force attack.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Maybe a place you loved, or a specific car, an attraction
     from a vacation, or a favorite restaurant?</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>You really need to have different username / password
     combinations for everything. Remember, the technique is to break into
     anything you access just to figure out your standard password, then
     compromise everything else. This doesn’t work if you don’t use the same
     password everywhere.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Once you’ve thought of a password, try Microsoft’s <a
     href="https://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/privacy/password_checker.mspx">password
     strength tester</a> to find out how secure it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that some of the passwords you think matter
least <strong>actually matter most</strong>. For example, some people think
that the password to their e-mail box isn’t important because “I don’t get
anything sensitive there.” Well, that e-mail box is probably connected to your
online banking account. If I can compromise it then I can log into the Bank’s
Web site and tell it I’ve forgotten my password to have it e-mailed to me. Now,
what were you saying about it not being important?</p>

<p>Often times people also reason that all of their passwords and logins are
stored on their computer at home, which is save behind a router or firewall
device. Of course, they’ve never bothered to change the default password on
that device, so someone could drive up and park near the house, use a laptop to
breach the wireless network and then try passwords from <a
href="http://www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html">this list</a> until they gain
control of your network - after which time they will own you!</p>

<p>Now I realize that every day we encounter people who over-exaggerate points
in order to move us to action, but trust me this is not one of those times.
There are 50 other ways you can be compromised and punished for using weak
passwords that I haven’t even mentioned.</p>

<p>I also realize that most people just don’t care about all this until it’s
too late and they’ve learned a very hard lesson. But why don’t you do me, and
yourself, a favor and take a little action to strengthen your passwords and let
me know that all the time I spent on this article wasn’t completely in vain.</p>
